    <p>We are working for some time now to upgrade all the Hoa libraries to use
    PHP 7.1 features. This is a hard path to follow but, for sure, it'll move
    the code forward.</p>
    <p>Despite the performance upgrade, <a href="https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php">PHP
    5.X is officially dead since 2019/01/01</a>, there is nothing to block
    adoption of newer version anymore.</p>
    <p>Let's take a look at the biggest advantages of that future update :</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Scalar type declaration,</li>
      <li>Use <code>hoa/option</code>,</li>
      <li>Refactor and update some method naming.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Based on those updates, we'll have the ability to simplify PHPDoc
    comments and use Kitab to generate a clean documentation. The code will be
    even more solid based on the new scalar types declaration.</p>
    <p>Also this will introduce a natural BC Break so we'll take care of the
    release process correctly.</p>
